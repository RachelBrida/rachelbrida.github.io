<h1>Poems by Lewis Carrol</h1>

<p>Jabberwocky</p>
'Twas brillig, and the <strong>slithy</strong> toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

<h2>'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!</h2>
The jaws that <em>bite</em>, the claws that catch!
<h3>Beware the <strong>Jubjub bird</strong>, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!'</h3>
<ul>
   <li>He took his vorpal sword in hand:</li>
   <li>Long time the manxome foe he sought --</li>
   <li>So rested he by the Tumtum tree,</li>
   <li>And stood a while in thought.</li>
</ul>
</li>

And, as in uffish thought he stood,
<h4>The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,</h4>
Came <em>whiffling</em> through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!
<ol>
   <li>One two! One two! And through and through</li>
   <li>The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!</li>
   <li>He left it dead, and with its head</li>
   <li>He went galumphing back.</li>
</ol>

'And hast thou <em>slain</em> the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
Oh frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
He <strong>chortled in his joy</strong>.

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

The Walrus and the Carpenter
The sun was shining on the sea,
<h5>Shining with all his might:</h5>
<ul>
   <li>He did his very best to make</li>
   <li>The billows smooth and bright --</li>
   <li>And this was odd, because it was</li>
   <li>The middle of the night.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<footer>The moon was shining sulkily,</footer>
Because she thought the <emsun</em>
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done --
<h1>'It's very rude of him.' she said,</h1>
'To come and spoil the fun!'

The sea was wet as wet could be,
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overhead --
There were no birds to fly.

The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand:
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand:
'If this were only cleared away,'
They said, 'it would be grand.'

<h6>'If seven maids with seven mops
Swept it for half a year,
Do you suppose,' the Walrus said,
'That they could get it clear?'
'l doubt it,' said the Carpenter,
And shed a bitter tear.</h6>

<h1>'O Oysters, come and walk with us!
The Walrus did beseech.
'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each.'</h1>

The eldest Oyster looked at him,
But never a word he said:
<h2>The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
And shook his heavy head --</h2>
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the oyster-bed.

<h5>Out four young Oysters hurried up.
All eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat --
And this was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.</h5>

<div>Four other Oysters followed them,
And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more --
All hopping through the frothy <em>waves</em>,
And scrambling to the shore.</div>

<ol>
   <li>The Walrus and the Carpenter</li>
   <li>Walked on a mile or so,</li>
   <li>And then they rested on a rock</li>
   <li>Conveniently low:</li>
   <li>And all the little Oysters stood</li>
   <li>And waited in a row.</li>
</ol>

<p>'The time has come,' the Walrus said,
'To talk of many things:
Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing wax --
Of cabbages -- and kings --
And why the sea is boiling hot --
And whether pigs have wings.'</p>

'But wait a bit,' the <strong>Oysters</strong> cried,
'Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat!'
'No hurry!' said the Carpenter.
They <em>thanked</em> him much for that.

'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said,
'Is what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed --
Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,
We can begin to feed.'

<h3>'But not on us!' the Oysters cried,
Turning a little blue.
'After such kindness, that would be
A dismal thing to do!'
'The night is fine,' the Walrus said,
'Do you admire the view?'</h3>

<em>'It was so kind of you to come!
And you are very nice!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
'Cut us another slice-
I wish you were not quite so deaf-
I've had to ask you twice!'</em>

<h4>'It seems a shame,' the Walrus said,
'To play them such a trick.
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
'The butter's spread too thick!'</h4>

'I weep for you,'the Walrus said:
'I deeply sympathize.'
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.

'O Oysters,' said the Carpenter,
'You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?'
But answer came there none --
And this was scarcely odd, because
<p>They'd eaten every one.</p>
